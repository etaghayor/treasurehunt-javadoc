after the server got started use

```$ make gui```

in treasurehunt directory to have a graphic interface for client. you can also use

Then, create your map :
you can vary the size of the map, the number of holes and treasures, and select a game mode, you have the 3 choices for game modes :
- Speeding contest : a time trial, the fastest wins
- Round by round : during this mode, you have to wait your turn to play
- For of war : the rules are a little bit different, you have a limited visibility around the player, you can't see the whole board.
